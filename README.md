Smart Alarm Android app wakes you up before you reach your pre-set destination. A boon for frequent long distance commuters on public transport ;) This location based alerting application allows you to get your precious napZZss... or read or listen to music while you commute, without having to worry about whether youâ€™ll miss your stop. 

How does the application work ?

As soon as you open application, on Home page you have to set the destination location on which you need alert upon reaching it. This destination location can be set either by entering address on Address input box or by clicking View Map button. Now, you can select location by pin pointing on the map, where you can see your current location pointed by blue marker. Here you can set the Geo-fence radius either by dragging the arrow on map, by entering radius value on radius input box or by dragging the pointer at the bottom. If you want to save the changes made, you have to press submit, and if you want to discard the changes, you have to click on close button.

Once you set the destination location and radius of the fence you just have to click on the toggle button on top right corner to turn on the tracker. Upon turning on, the algorithm will calculate the remaining distance to your destination & updates device's network connection status.

Upon turning on the tracker, application will smartly keep a track on your device's current location and notifies you once you are close enough to the destination. This application runs in background even if you have minimized the application.
